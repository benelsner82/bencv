abstract="Almost a decade has passed since the Eastern enlargement of the European Union (EU) in 2004. Germany has been a special case among the old member states of the EU for at least two reasons. First, the country restricted access to its labor markets for workers from the New Member States (NMS) until 2011, and second, the German labor market weathered the Great Recession without an increase in unemployment. In this chapter, we analyze how both events -- the EU enlargement and the economic crisis -- have shaped migration flows to Germany.",
