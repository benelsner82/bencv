# Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of labour economics, international economics, and environmental economics. I currently pursue three strands of research: 
\medskip

1. impact of **migration** on the sending and receiving countries,

2. impact of the **environment** (especially pollution) on human capital formation, 

3. the effect of **peers** and teachers on human capital,
